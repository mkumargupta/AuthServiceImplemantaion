#iOS To make the token easily hashtag#accessible throughout your project in hashtag#swift, you can utilize a hashtag#singleton pattern with the hashtag#AuthServiceImpl class and provide a central way to fetch and cache the token. This allows other parts of the project to retrieve the token without repeatedly calling the hashtag#API.


// Example of using APIManager to perform a request
  Task {
      do {
          let data = try await APIManager.shared.performRequest(endpoint: "your-endpoint")
          // Process the data
          print("Response data:", data)
      } catch {
          print("Error performing request:", error)
      }
  }
